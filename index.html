<p>The reason that I have chosen these games and not some of the newer releases
 is that most of the games on this list are what got me into playing video 
games. Lets take the games Halo and Crysis 2, they were the first xbox games I 
had ever played which is a big reason that they are on the list. Then there is 
the Tom Clancy series of the Division 1 & 2 which have one of the best 
storylines that will drag you in to the point of needing to find out 
what happens next as the basic storyline came pretty close to real life 
with covid-19. The Dead Space trilogy also had a great storyline, the only 
downside wass that the third game ended on a massive cliff hanger as they were 
planing for a fourth game wich was sadly canceled. and these were just some of 
the games on the list,
